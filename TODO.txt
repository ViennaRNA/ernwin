* Radius of Gyration energy should not be infinity.
       - This is because the target distribution is too narrow, so it needs to be widened with a longer tail
* Allow the toggling of energies, perhaps by listing them in an additional input file
* Think and research about the resampling in case of clashes. 
  We do not want to bias our sampling towards certain (e.g. more extended) structures.

FAR-FETCHED
-----------

* Estimate a radius of gyration distribution from Cryo-EM data
* Even more generally, estimate any energy function from Cryo-EM data
