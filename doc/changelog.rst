Release Notes
=============

Release Version 0.1
-------------------

For this release, some non-core parts of the ernwin program have been restructured.
Therefore most files in fess/scripts are outdated and do not work.
The only tested script is `ernwin_new.py`

Changes from earlier versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Use ernwin_new.py instead of ernwin_go.py
