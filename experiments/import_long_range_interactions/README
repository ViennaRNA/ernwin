This experiment will seek to determine which are the most important long range interactions for creating the observed tertiary structure.

PURPOSE: To decide which types of long range interactions are the most important to predict.

METHOD: 
    1. Determine the long range interactions which are present in a given RNA tertiary structure
        a) These are denoted by a hydrogen bond in a non-helical region

    2. Iterate through each interaction and use it's target distance as an energy function
        a) Record the distribution of energy ~ rmsd values
        b) Record the minimum rmsd found given that energy function

    3. Calculate which long range interactions lead to the smallest rmsd in the sampled structures.

HYPOTHESIS:
     I expect that interaction between the two furthest elements will lead to the greatest improvement in RMSD over random sampling.

FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS:
    1. If we pick any two random elements in the structure and indicate an interaction between them. Will the ones that lead to the greatest decrease in structural RMSD be present in the real structure?
